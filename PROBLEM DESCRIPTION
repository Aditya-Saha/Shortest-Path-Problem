Shortest path problem is about finding a path between two vertices in such a way that this path will satisfy some criteria of optimization .
It can be determined by DIJKSTRA,S algorithm.

DIJKSTRA,S algorithm is single source initiated shortest path algorithm.

The graph used to implement the DIJKSTRA,S algorithm is attached and the code is done using adjacency matrix representations of graph.
